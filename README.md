>Add missing keyboard shortcuts to various streaming services

Any decent video player of a streaming service supports standard keyboard shortcuts. At least <kbd>Space</kbd> for toggling play state and ⬅️/ ➡️for rewinding/fast-forwarding, respectively.

Unfortunately, all players are not decent, by default. **Playmo** is here to fill the expectation gap and _Make Players Great Again™_.

## Supported services
- HBO Nordic
- Dplay (_coming soon_)

## Keyboard shortcuts
- <kbd>Space</kbd>: Toggle play state (play/pause)
- (<kbd>Shift</kbd> +) ⬅️: Rewind (60) 10 seconds
- (<kbd>Shift</kbd> +) ➡️: Fast-forward (60) 10 seconds
